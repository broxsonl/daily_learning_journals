Learning Journal - LJ_code201_day03.md

I enjoyed looking at Bronwyn’s code! I was secretly hoping that the class would look at my code because i wanted to get some feedback on it, and because I felt pretty proud of it. Hopefully some of my code can be reviewed in the future.

As we went over while loops, I had an a-ha moment from yesterday. I was trying to get any user entry in my questions on my about_me page yesterday that was not y/n/yes/no to force the person to answer again. I didn’t know how to do this, but with a while loop I would be able to make them go back to the prompt and enter it the way I want them to.

When I went to lunch, I told Adrian that I would like to whiteboard out the problems we were trying to solve with the development work we were doing. I was hoping we could actively collaborate. We started doing this, problem solving and figuring it out, and then others started joining in with us and helping us problem solve through it all. It was an awesome experience. I also found that white boarding it helped me learn. Writing it down was amazing for learning. Explaining it to the other people who joined in and who didn’t understand it was an amazing way for me to learn myself.

We thought that for the 7th question we had figured it out, and were about to move on, but we encountered about 20 different problems and spent another 90 minutes trying to figure it out. :D

With Sam's help, we were able to quickly and easily modify our existing code for the tally part, completing the 3rd of the challenges successfully.

All-in-all, this was an amazing day. I learned a lot, used my brain in ridiculous ways, and had a lot of chances to coach and share the things I was learning with others, which helped me understand them a lot better.
