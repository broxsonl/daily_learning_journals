# LJ Code 201 - *Day 8*

Today was a tough one. While collaborating with Sera and Adrian, I ran into several problems. I think the exhaustion of the last few days, combined with the distraction of minor drama during lab, has worn be down a bit. I had a tougher time focusing today than I have for the entire course.

As a result of the lack of focus, I still feel a tad hazy on the concepts we actually coded today. I understand events, event handlers and event listeners...but am having a bit of a tough time understand where/how they interacted with the rest of the code and the other documents. I need to work on this and practice it more.

I spent 2-3 hours after class trying to get the stretch goal working in my code, but as not successful. I was pretty bummed out, but realized I didn't have the knowledge or the skillset to finish the work myself. I have decided to hang it up for the night and ask about it tomorrow so my confusion can be cleared up by Sam or a TA.

All-in-all, a tough day, but a good set of learnings for the day.
