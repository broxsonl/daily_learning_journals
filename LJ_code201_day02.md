# LJ Code 201 - Day 2

It was awesome to finally put a lot of this stuff into practice.

Cmnd + Option + J as a way to check the source is helpful. I also learned, with Annaka’s help, how to view in the source where an error may lie in the code (specifically what line!) that could be breaking it.

She also helped show me that to test the code I knew was working WITHOUT the code I knew wasn’t working, I could easily just highlight the entire new code selection with Cmnd + / to comment the code out to “deactivate it”. This is a concept I knew and understood from learning about it, but I had yet to apply it in any sort of practical environment. That was really exciting. :D

I found one way to convert the answers to the prompt to lower case using the .toLowerCase function, and then shared it with Sam and Annaka because it wasn’t working properly. They in turn showed me a “more elegant” way of doing it, though also how to make the method I was using work properly. I followed that up by sharing with the folks sitting next to me what they had told me, thus “blowing” their minds. It was extremely collaborative and felt like I was working on a team. :)

At one point, I was getting annoyed with checking the status of my html and css because my javascript prompts kept coming up and it was irritating. I had the creative idea of commenting out the link to the javascript document so that I could work on the html and css while repeatedly refreshing for the time being.

I started feeling a bit fried, so I left CF to walk home. It's about a 30 minute walk home. Listened to some podcasts, caught some Pokemon, walked, and then ate and talked with my girlfriend when I got home. After a couple of hours of break, I finished the CSS and HTML parts of the project. Admittedly, I was procrastinating on working on those parts of the project, but I felt much better once I actually just did it.
