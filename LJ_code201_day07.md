# LJ Code 201 - *Day 7*

Today was awesome. I collaborated with Adrian all day and we worked extremely hard to find the solutions to as much of the lab as we could. We got a lot of help from Munir and Sam, and were able to work through a lot of it on our own.

I started out the day having a really difficult time understanding the way Javascript can interact with html elements and create new elements within an html element. With all of the practice we did today with it--interacting with tables--I have a MUCH better grasp on how to do this. I want to practice more, but I'm feeling pretty good about it.

All-in-all, a tough day, but a reasonably difficult one. Every day I learn a ton of coding skills and concepts, but I also learn a lot about my learning style and the way I process through problems. I am enjoying all of these learnings, and can't wait for more!
