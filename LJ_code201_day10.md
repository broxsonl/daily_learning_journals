# LJ Code 201 - *Day 10*

End of week two. Halfway done with the class, and 1/8 the way done with the entire CF course through 401.

Pretty crazy. It's only been a short time, but there's been so much information densely-packed into a small space. I'm excited to continue learning.

It was fun to do a timed project and see how well we could manage our css when the rubber met the road. I'd say the best lesson from the day was forcing yourself to keep calm and cool while under the pressure of a deadline. Getting anxious and freaking out will just impair your ability to do work, so keeping a level head and doing the work methodically is the only way to go, really.

Also enjoyed working with Taiwan for a perspective from another person in the class I haven't had much interaction with yet.
