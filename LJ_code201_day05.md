# LJ Code 201 - *Day 5*

Today was the end to a long week. I'm actually sort of sad to go into the weekend right now. I've been really enjoying doing this all week, and feeling so immersed in working on code. It's strange to think of not doing this all day for the next two days...maybe I'll go practice some Javascript.

Today myself, Adrian, Rachel, Britt and Sera all collaborated together on the lab assignment. Sera was a little bit behind because of some Git issues she was having, so as we finished one problem, I was able to work with her to help explain how to go about solving the problems. This helped me to learn and understand what I was doing even more. I probably learned more from doing that than anything else.

Working together with a group of people like this is amazing, and I don't know if there's a better way to learn this stuff. Just talking out loud is very helpful to critically work through so many things.

All-in-all, this has been a great week, and I am so excited to continue down this path.
