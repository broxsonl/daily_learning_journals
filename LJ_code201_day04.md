# LJ Code 201 - *Day 4*

It was really fun to look at my code in class today at the start. It’s a bit nerve-wracking, but I felt pretty confident about my code. I was surprised that we found a problem that was the center of discussion for 20+ minutes. I really liked that that happened. I really enjoy looking at code together as a class, and am hoping to do more of that in the future. :)

Sam said, “command over Javascript functions is essential to being a JS developer.’ I am going to keep this in mind as I move eventually to Code 401 Javascript. I’ve been most excited and passionate about Javascript so far, and I want to immerse myself as entirely as possible.

Britt and I ended up finishing about two hours early (3pm) and it was good to have the extra time available to do the next day’s reading, among other things. It was a bit more of a chill day than usual, but the principles involved with doing collar coding are so huge. It’s very easy to try and get into a state of mind where you think you can do all of this brilliantly without others, but it really is more efficient to be working with someone else.

I can imagine collab coding at a higher level can get frustrating if two people code differently or have differing opinions on certain syntax uses, but I think the pros outweigh the cons on this one. Everybody else is going to be good at certain aspects of this that I am not good at, and vice versa.

I’m having such a blast with this so far, for the record. Can’t wait for new stuff tomorrow!
