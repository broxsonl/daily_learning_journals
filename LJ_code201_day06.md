# LJ Code 201 - *Day 6*

TODAY WAS SO HARD.

You weren't kidding on Friday. I was anxious all weekend about how tough this was going to be, and the way it sounds, tomorrow will be tougher.

I kept finding myself running out of steam and really hitting walls of both exhaustion and stress while trying to do jump my brain through the hoops it needed to to understand these concepts.

I think I got it near the end, but I had a bit less of a collaborative experience than usual and would've liked to have talked the solutions through/taught them to someone a bit more so that I can try and better understand them with someone.

All in all, a busy and tough day.
