# LJ Code 201 - *Day 12*

I completed a lot of what Tuesday was spent on Monday night. Was able to take Tuesday a bit more relaxed, and spent some time cleaning up my code, commenting all over to make it clear, and moving the code to better, more conventional positioning. It was very helpful to spend some time on this today.

Productive day...not much to say for this one.
