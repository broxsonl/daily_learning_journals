# LJ Code 201 - Day 1

I learned many things. I learned that I can't spell var properly and constantly type varr, apparently. :( I had no idea. I'm hoping I can still be reasonably adequate with Javascript, but only time will tell.

Met a lot of really interesting people from a lot of interesting backgrounds. It was a lot of fun getting to hear the different places that people ceom from.

Sam is a really excellent teacher. Clear and concise, he is easy to follow along with, and I'm happy that he is instructing.

I have never really used Apple computer products before, so it is a big shift to get used to using them now. Having the same computer OS as what the instructor is showing and everyone else is using is HUGELY helpful, and makes following along a lot easier. I never thought I'd be a Mac user, but hey, sometimes that's just how things go.

He told us that the first day is weird A LOT. :)

All in all, I feel that today was A LOT of fun and made me feel very encouraged for the classes to come. I had a lot of fears about doing well--especially when related to the reality of leaving my job for the program--and many of them were set at ease when speaking to the fact that everyone is feeling similarly, and what I was feeling was natural.

Excited for tomorrow!
