# LJ Code 201 - *Day 9*

Today was a weird day. I had started last night working on getting my Javascript to rewrite an already-existent entry into the table. It was the first thing I pursued working on and took me 4 hours to finally work through (with some help from Adrian, Maelle and Aaron).

It was difficult. Difficult and frustrating. I think I was chasing it like it was my white whale, and I should have left it alone and come back to it later. It occupied my brain for around 24 hours, making bits of headway here and there, and it of course turned out to be a simple solution.

As for HTML/CSS, I've worked on drawing out a Wireframe for the way my page will look, and I have started setting up many of my html elements to take the CSS properly. I drew out a wireframe of container in container in container in container etc and have coded the structure for my html of my index page. I've also added all of the elements to my stylesheet and done a little tinkering so far.

Today didn't feel so scary from a "I hope I don't fall behind" perspective, but it was still a lot of work. I've worked with developers who've spent a day or more on a single problem...now I understand.
