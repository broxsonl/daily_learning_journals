# LJ Code 201 - *Day 11*

Today was fun, but a bit tough. I felt much more well-equipped to take on the challenges so far than I did last week in the face of the Salmon Cookies.

Collab work with Adrian, Rachel, Maelle, Taiwan, etc today. Was a good session with a lot of ideas being shared between us all.

We managed to get most of the way through the project together while still on campus. I left with the intention of working through a couple of other problems later.

Worked for about 4 hours at a bar to try and figure out how to:

- Fix the per click tally
- Generate only pictures that were not generated on the prior generation
